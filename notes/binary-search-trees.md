# Binary Search Trees

Binary search trees (BST) are {{#page}}binary-trees{{/page}} with ordered nodes.

For a given node, the right child (and its decendants) have greater
values and the left child (and its decendants) have lesser values; if the tree
permits duplicate values, they go to the left as well.

Thanks to this ordering, inserting, finding, and removing in-place are
{{#bigo}}h{{/bigo}}.
