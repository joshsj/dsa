# Trees

{{#dl}}{{/dl}}

Trees are a form of {{#page}}graphs:graph{{/page}} that specifically represent a
hierarchy.

The root of a tree is the node with no parent (the one at the top). A leaf is a node
with no children.

The height of a tree is count of nodes between the root and the furthest leaf.

A tree is balanced when any node's left and right children have the same height.

## Binary Trees

Binary trees contain nodes with 2 children at most.

## Binary Search Trees

Binary search trees are binary trees with ordered nodes.

Typically, for a given node, the right child (and its decendants) have greater
values and the left child (and its decendants) have lesser values; if the tree
permits duplicate values, they go to the left.
