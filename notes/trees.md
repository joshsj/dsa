# Trees

{{#dl}}{{/dl}}

Trees are a form of {{#page}}graphs:graph{{/page}} that specifically represent a
hierarchy.

Binary trees have 2 children at most.

Binary search trees are binary trees with ordered nodes, typically where the children 
of a given node have a greater value.

The root of a tree is the node with no parent (the one at the top). A leaf is a node
with no children.

The height of a tree is count of nodes between the root and the furthest leaf.

A tree is balanced when any node's left and right children have the same height.
