# Recursion

Recursion is one tool in the DSA belt to implement algorithms effectively.

The following is almost verbatim from the {{#ref}}recursion-wiki: wikipedia

{{/aside}}

In its formal definition, a algorithm is recursive when it has the two
following properties:

1. A base case (or cases): a terminating scenario that does not use recursion to
produce an answer.
2. A recursive step: logic which works towards the base case and ultimately recurs.

## Why?

Some algorithms are more simple to express recursively instead of iteratively.
