# Complexity

I'm Josh — a spirited software developer from Manchester seeking a job in full stack web development. Any tech stack is a good tech stack, but .NET, Vue and SQL is my jam.

I have a First in Software Engineering from Sheffield Hallam, 14 months experience developing full-stack web applications from a placement at 3Squared, and a slowly improving grasp of French. Avec Duolingo, je m'améliore tous les jours.

When I'm not coding, I'm tinkering with my bike and mechanical keyboards. Most evenings involve cooking and music, and I've followed Formula 1 and the professional CS:GO scene for years.
